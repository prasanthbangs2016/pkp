script is running even if i am not root user.

need to edit file from cli.

fetch mysql password and parse it somewhere else.(variables) --solved
  we're resetting the password by going /var/log/mysqld.log fetching it copying it parsing it somewhere else.
  sudo grep temp /var/log/mysqld.log
  sudo grep 'A temporary password' /var/log/mysqld.log
  column based filter using awk
  sudo grep 'A temporary password' /var/log/mysqld.log | awk '{print $11}'
  or fetching last field
  sudo grep 'A temporary password' /var/log/mysqld.log | awk '{print $NF}'

 new problem
==============
since password is already changed,it is failing on rerun of the script.
  


need to handle error

command is successful or failure is not handled.

if anything fails in btw it was not stopping,it will proceed
  set -e is the solution. this also have a limition hence we have proceeded our own handling errors.



enhancements:
=============
output(whatever we run it is showing on screen,not needed)
 this can be done using redirectors

Redirectors:
-----------
input(>)  ---- input to the file
output(<)  --- output to the file
override/append(>>) --- append

STDOUT(1>)(>) : only output

STDERR(2>): only error

STDOUT & STDERR(&>)
both output and error will be redirected to the samefile

&>/dev/null : nullifying if any error is coming


question
==========
how set command is stopping the execution if there was an error?
sol: may be error keyword or already exist keyword and stop it there itself.
this set -e will not help all the times.

code standards
-----------------
1-rerun should not fail
2-code shouldnt have any password
  export MYSQL_PASSWORD=Roboshop@1
3-keep the code dry
